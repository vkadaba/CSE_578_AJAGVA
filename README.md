Summary of chosen VAST MC Challenge 
The VAST Challenge for 2021 is centered around the disappearance of employees from an energy company, GAStech. The Tethys-based company GAStech operates a very profitable natural gas production site within the country of Kronos, and over the years has established strong ties to the government of Kronos itself. During a celebration of GAStech’s IPO, a handful of employees have mysteriously gone missing. The challenge itself provides some possible motive, namely a less-than-stellar environmental track record. Additionally, the group “The Protectors of Kronos (POK)” are identified as suspects in the disappearance, but the challenge warns “things may not be what they seem.”
For MC2, we are tasked with aiding law enforcement from both Kronos and Tethys in analyzing movement and tracking data. Within the framework of the Nested Design Model, these law enforcement groups constitute the primary users within the domain. It is worth noting that additional users within the domain exist, such as GAStech management and visual analytics experts. GAStech employees are tracked in the following ways: A log of which employee is assigned to a given vehicle, GPS logs from company vehicles, credit card purchases, purchase preferences logged by loyalty cards, and geospatial shapefiles of Abila and Kronos. Using this data, we must identify anomalous and suspicious behavior of GAStech employees in the two weeks preceding the disappearance. Over the course of the challenge, the following five tasks must be completed to accomplish this:
1. Identify the most popular locations and peak business times using credit and loyalty card data. Then seek anomalies in the data and provide recommendations to correct the anomalies.
2.  Incorporate vehicle GPS data into the analysis, then reanalyze the anomalies and identify discrepancies between the datasets. 
3. Infer the owners of each credit card and loyalty card with supporting evidence. Identify uncertainties in both the data as well as inference methodology.
4. Determine informal or unofficial relationships between GAStech employees and provide supporting evidence.
5. Conclude the analysis and provide evidence of any suspicious activity. Additionally, identify 1-10 locations where this activity is occurring.

## Vehicle GPS data is not included in this repo.
